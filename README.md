# Ovol Salesbot

[Ovols](https://docs.elixirnft.io/nectars-and-pfps/ovols) is a 10k pfp project built on [Solana](https://solana.com/). Any time someone buys an Ovol (a sale is made), this bot will [tweet about it](https://twitter.com/ovol_salesbot).

## Getting Started

To run this project, you'll need a Twitter account with [elevated access to the API](https://developer.twitter.com/en/docs/twitter-api/getting-started/getting-access-to-the-twitter-api). This is required because the project uses [OAuth 1.0a User Context](https://developer.twitter.com/en/docs/authentication/oauth-1-0a)

1. Clone the repo

    ```bash
    git clone
    ```

2. Start the dev server

    ```bash
    yarn dev
    ```
